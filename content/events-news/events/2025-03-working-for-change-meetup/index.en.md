description: Join our first informal storytelling meetup on civic engagement topics
---

Join the first event of a new series of informal meetings. In a storytelling format we will engage in discussions, activities, community coaching, and networking on topics related to civic participation and experiences of foreigners living in Prague.

**Bring your friends**  
**Bring your ideas**  
**Join the conversation!**

## First Topic: How to work for change in your country of origin and make a difference where you live

Many of us living in Prague maintain connections to our countries of origin while building new lives here. This creates unique opportunities and challenges when it comes to civic engagement. How do we balance our desire to create positive change "back home" with our responsibility to contribute to the communities where we now live?

Join us for an interactive discussion where we'll explore:
- Strategies for staying engaged with issues in your home country
- Ways to make a meaningful impact in Prague's local community
- Building bridges between different causes and communities
- Managing time, energy, and emotional investment across multiple contexts
- Learning from each other's experiences and approaches

## Format

This will be an informal, storytelling-based meetup. We'll create a welcoming space where participants can share their experiences, challenges, and successes. No formal presentations – just authentic conversation and mutual learning.

## Who Should Attend

- Anyone with a migration background living in Prague
- People interested in civic engagement and community building
- Individuals balancing connections to multiple communities
- Anyone curious about different approaches to creating positive change
