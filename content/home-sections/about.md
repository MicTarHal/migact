# About MigAct
MigAct is a community-driven organization based in Prague, committed to fostering an inclusive environment where residents—whether of migration backgrounds or Czech-born—can actively participate in civic life. We create collaborative spaces, provide educational activities, and offer multilingual resources to meet the practical needs of individuals and organizations. We engage in reducing barriers to full civic participation, guided by the values of cooperation, equity, responsibility, and active participation. As a diverse community of individuals, organizations, and institutions, we believe in co-creating and actively involving our supporters in our development and programs.
