As co-founder of MigAct, I co-lead strategic planning, development, and program design while leading our community-building efforts. With over 15 years of experience in the Czech civil society sector, I've organized cultural festivals and community events, led workshops, and contributed to social initiatives both locally and internationally. My background in social communication and intercultural work, along with my ongoing studies in socio-cultural anthropology, allows me to bring a unique perspective shaped by my upbringing outside the Western context. I believe deeply in the power of collaboration, community, and civic engagement. Outside of work, I enjoy long walks in nature, journaling, meditating, watching films, playing games, and exploring new cultures.
