As co-founder of MigAct, I co-lead strategic planning, development, and program design while leading our community-building efforts. With over 15 years of experience in the Czech civil society sector, I've organized cultural festivals and community events, led workshops, and contributed to social initiatives both locally and internationally. My background in social communication and intercultural work, along with my ongoing studies in socio-cultural anthropology, allows me to bring a unique perspective shaped by my upbringing outside the Western context. I believe deeply in the power of collaboration, community, and civic engagement. Outside of work, I enjoy long walks in nature, journaling, meditating, watching films, playing games.

## Team Members

### Suzanne Verhaar - Social Media Manager
![Suzanne Verhaar](/images/team/suzanne-verhaar.jpeg)

I have joined MigAct to help spread its important message: our society thrives when individuals with migration backgrounds actively participate in civil life and are recognized for the wealth of knowledge, experience, and energy they contribute. When I arrived in Prague, bringing a background in Russian Studies, Political Science, and a decade-long career in Railway Management, I discovered not only the joy but also the necessity of active civic engagement. This journey has profoundly enriched me, allowing me to grow as a person and find stability in an uncertain world. I hope to inspire others to explore these opportunities and connect with the wider global community. I am a freelancer working at the intersection of business administration, project management, and social development. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, cycling, exploring new languages, and diving into historical studies and novels.
