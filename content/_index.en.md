# About us
## About MigAct
MigAct is a community-driven organization based in Prague, committed to fostering an inclusive environment where residents—whether of migration backgrounds or Czech-born—can actively participate in civic life. We create collaborative spaces, provide educational activities, and offer multilingual resources to meet the practical needs of individuals and organizations. We engage in reducing barriers to full civic participation, guided by the values of cooperation, equity, responsibility, and active participation. As a diverse community of individuals, organizations, and institutions, we believe in co-creating and actively involving our supporters in our development and programs.

# What we do
## Four ways we foster community, knowledge, and participation in Prague
MigAct Meetups
:   Connect with locals, informal groups, and civic initiatives. Network, share know-how, and support each other. 

Learning Hubs
:   Workshops, events and programs that support Prague residents with migration backgrounds acquire the skills and knowledge they need for civic participation. Ideal for those looking to become civically active... 

Mentoring
:   Personalized consultations for people with migration backgrounds on civic and political participation. Community projects, voting rights, volunteering, establishing your own association, etc. 

Civic Incubators
:   We work closely with Prague City Hall on collaborative workshops and assemblies aimed at involving people with migration backgrounds in decision-making.
