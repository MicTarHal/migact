# MigAct Meetups
Connect with locals, informal groups, and civic initiatives. Network, share know-how, and support each other. 
# Learning Hubs
Workshops, events and programs that support Prague residents with migration backgrounds acquire the skills and knowledge they need for civic participation. Ideal for those looking to become civically active... 
# Mentoring
Personalized consultations for people with migration backgrounds on civic and political participation. Community projects, voting rights, volunteering, establishing your own association, etc. 
# Civic Incubators
We work closely with Prague City Hall on collaborative workshops and assemblies aimed at involving people with migration backgrounds in decision-making.
